Dinner menu generator
This is an application that takes into account what ingredients the user has in his/her refrigerator and generates a list of dishes along with their respective recipes. Before getting into the functionalities, the user must generate an account which stores information such as household size, account user name, and password. Once logged in, the user would be able to input what ingredients are available/ in stock at home. Then, with a click of a button, the application would generate the list of recipes accordingly. 

In order to run the application, download the java files and the res folder. Once inside Android Studio, upload those files in their corresponding location and change AndroidManifest.xml accordingly. 

NOTE: the xml files responsible for buttons and layouts are in the subfolder "layout" under "res".
